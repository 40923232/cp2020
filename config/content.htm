<p></p>
<p><span>In this module, we are going to cover the various types of networks, including local area networks, wide area networks, personal area networks, and metropolitan area networks. Next, we will cover the various network relationships, such as client/server and peer-to-peer, and focus on the types of resources our networks use. Finally, we will talk about the topologies of our networks, such as the bus, the ring, the star, the full mesh, and hybrid network topologies.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #00ccff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Networks are defined by the geography they cover. We start with the area around a si</span></span>ngle person, with this area being termed the personal area network (PAN). Next, we expand outward to the local area network (LAN), which can contain an entire office floor or building. Moving outward again, we have the metropolitan area network, which covers the area across the city by connecting multiple LANs together. Finally, we have the wide area network (WAN). This is the largest network we define by geography and it can go across the country or even across the world. A great example of a WAN is the Internet, since it connects many networks together and stretches across the globe.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span title="Quick scroll up">A PAN has a very small range limited to just a few meters. If you stretch your hands out at your sides and spin around in a circle, this is the physical range of most PANs. Bluetooth is one of the main things we use to create a PAN, although USB and infrared can also be used for these networks. Bluetooth has a range between one meter and 100 meters depending on which class of Bluetooth you are using, but most common Bluetooth devices are class two devices limited to 10 meters. Some good examples of PANs are the connection between a USB hard drive and a laptop, or a Bluetooth cellphone connecting to your car stereo system wirelessly.</span></span></p>

<h3>Network Defined by Relationships(關係定義的網路)</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span title="Quick scroll up"></span></span></p>
<p><span>In addition to defining networks by geography or how much area they cover, you can also define them by the way they allocate their resources. The first method is what we call a client/server model. In a client/server model, a dedicated server or servers provide(s) access to files, scanners, printers, and other resources to client workstations. This simplifies the administration and backup burden, making the network centrally administered, and can provide better security because resources can be allocated according to job function, network privilege, or department, since all of the resources are located on a few key servers. The second way of sharing resources on the network is called the peer-to-peer model. In the peer-to-peer model, all workstations are considered equals: each computer or workstation shares its resources directly with the other workstations. There is no central administration. For example, if I shared my printer with my coworkers, then each time my coworker printed a document, it would be sent to the printer through my workstation. The drawback to this is that if my computer is turned off, my coworkers lose access to my resources, such as my printer. The administration and backup under the peer-to-peer model is much more difficult, since resources are located on numerous workstations across the network, making administrative tasks burdensome. Furthermore, there is no real way of securing network resources when allowing access between nodes or workstations. The benefit of peer-to-peer resource sharing is the low cost of entry, since no dedicated servers or specialized operating systems are required to share the resources.</span></p>
